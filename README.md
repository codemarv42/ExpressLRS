# ExpressLRS

ExpressLRS is an open source project that enables the connection between drone and remote control in an efficient way. To support the project itself a little bit, I have developed other hardware alternatives, which are of course also open source. To support the project visit: https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS
